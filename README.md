Welcome to the IncreasingCostTreeSearch project! This is the readme.

This repository provides a limited implementation of the Increasing Cost Tree Search algorithm.
It calculates paths for 2 agents with one waypoint.

The Increasing Cost Tree Search algorithm is described in the following paper:

Sharon, G., Stern, R., Goldenberg, M., & Felner, A. (2013). The increasing cost tree search for optimal multi-agent pathfinding. _Artificial Intelligence_, 195, 470-495.

Because of some implementation issues it does not show the paths correctly, but you can look through the code to see how I implemented it.
